Ruby code formatter written in Python for Sublime Text. This is pretty much a straight port of port from http://neontology.com/2006/05/10/beautiful-ruby-in-textmate

Installation:
1) Place prettyruby.py in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/
2) Bind a key to "pretty_ruby". I did this by changing the "build" key in "Default (OSX).sublime-keymap".

{ "keys": ["super+b"], "command": "pretty_ruby" },
